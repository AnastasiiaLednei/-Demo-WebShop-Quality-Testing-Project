 Description  	 
Objective: Ensure the website displays correctly and is functional across different screen sizes and resolutions by using browser extension tools.
Steps to Reproduce:
1.	Open the website on a desktop browser: 
o	Launch the website using a desktop browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).
2.	Use the browser's responsive design tools: 
o	For Google Chrome: 
1.	Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I on Mac).
2.	Click the "Toggle Device Toolbar" icon (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M).
3.	Select various device profiles (e.g., iPhone XR, iPad Mini) or manually adjust the dimensions to simulate different screen sizes and resolutions.
3.	Verify site responsiveness: 
o	Check the site's layout, content, and functionality at different screen sizes and resolutions using the responsive design tools.
o	Ensure that the site adapts correctly to various dimensions and maintains functionality.
4.	Test for specific scenarios: 
o	Portrait and Landscape Modes: Switch between portrait and landscape orientations if applicable.
o	Zoom Levels: Test different zoom levels to ensure the site remains usable.
Expected Result:
•	The website should display correctly and be fully functional across all simulated screen sizes and resolutions in the browser's responsive design tools.
Actual Result:
•	The site displays correctly and functions as expected in all simulated screen sizes and resolutions in the browser's responsive design tools.
Notes:
•	If the site displays correctly in browser emulation tools but not on actual devices, further investigation into device-specific issues may be required.
•	Document any discrepancies or issues observed during testing.

2.	Check Data Collection
Action: Sign up or log in to Practice Software Testing using the provided methods (e.g., Google Sign-In). Observe the types of personal data collected (e.g., email address).
Expected Result: Only the data described in the privacy policy (email address, profile information) is collected.
Actual Result: "Toolshop collects address and phone number during registration without Google Sign-In, which contradicts the privacy policy stating only email and profile info should be collected."
3.	Verify Data Encryption
Action: Use browser developer tools or a network analyzer to inspect the data transmission between the client and server when logging in or performing other actions.
Expected Result: All data transmitted should be encrypted (HTTPS).
Actual Result: All data transmitted during login and other actions was encrypted using HTTPS, as verified using browser developer tools
1.	Test Data Storage
Action: Check how data is stored, if accessible, or verify through application interfaces that data is managed according to the privacy policy.
Expected Result: Data should be stored securely and, if applicable, encrypted.
Actual Result: 
1.	Data Access: 
	Successfully retrieved user data from the API endpoint /users/me using a valid access token.
2.	Data Security: 
	Data is transmitted over HTTPS, ensuring secure transfer.
	No explicit information on server-side encryption in the privacy policy, but data is securely transferred.
3.	Compliance: 
	Data handling complies with the privacy policy as data is accessible through secure means.
2.	Check Data Deletion
Action: Input test data and then wait for the time period specified in the privacy policy. Verify if the data is removed after this time period.
Expected Outcome: Test data should be deleted after the specified time period (e.g., one hour). 11:54
3.	Inspect Third-Party Services
Action: Identify any third-party services used by Practice Software Testing (e.g., analytics services) and review their privacy policies.
Expected Result: Third-party services should have privacy policies that align with the practices described on Practice Software Testing.
Actual Result: The footer of the site contains only links to Unsplash and Test with Roy, with no third-party services that collect user data.
4.	Assess Access Control
Preconditions:
Access to the Practice Software Testing website.
User account for a regular user.
Actions:

3.	Check Access to Functions: 
	Ensure that there is no access to administrator functions or data of other users.
5.	Expected Result: 
o	The regular user should be able to edit only their own data without access to administrative functions or the data of other users.
6.	Actual Result: 
o	The First Name and Last Name were successfully changed, confirming that the user can edit their personal data.
7.	Review Security Measures
Actions: 
0.	Check SSL Certificate: 
	What to do: Open the website in a browser.
