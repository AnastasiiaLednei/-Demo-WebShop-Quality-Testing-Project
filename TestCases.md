2.	Click the "Toggle Device Toolbar" icon (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M).
3.	Select various device profiles (e.g., iPhone XR, iPad Mini) or manually adjust the dimensions to simulate different screen sizes and resolutions.
3.	Verify site responsiveness: 
o	Check the site's layout, content, and functionality at different screen sizes and resolutions using the responsive design tools.
o	Ensure that the site adapts correctly to various dimensions and maintains functionality.
4.	Test for specific scenarios:

•	The website should display correctly and be fully functional across all simulated screen sizes and resolutions in the browser's responsive design tools.
Actual Result:
•	The site displays correctly and functions as expected in all simulated screen sizes and resolutions in the browser's responsive design tools.
Notes:
•	If the site displays correctly in browser emulation tools but not on actual devices, further investigation into device-specific issues may be required.
•	Document any discrepancies or issues observed during testing.
